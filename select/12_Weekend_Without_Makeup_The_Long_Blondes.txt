Another weekend without makeup
another evening to myself
well, I guess that I won't be having the time of my life tonight
where do you go when you've finished work?
you should have been home an hour ago
I've got your tea laid out like some kind of fifties housewife
[chorus]
well I'll feed you, but I need you to make a little more effort
I don't like giving you the third degree
I just want what's due,what's due, what's due to me...
There are wants and there are needs
and they're two very different things
you can love or be in love, again,
they're two very different things,
yes they're two very different things
I need to talk but you're much too tired
you've got a job and if you don't get fired soon
I'll be extremely surprised
where do you go when you've finished work
you should have been back about an hour ago
you've left me fashioning a double bed and acting
like some kind of fifties housewife
[chorus]
I could be more than your landlady if you'd like,
but you don't like,
and neither do I
You and I, we're different
you and I, we're two very different things
you and I, we're different
you and I, we're two very different things
but still I've got you, I've got you under my skin...(3X)
I've got you under my skin
