[00:10.40] And said drink from me, drink from me (oh-ah-oh-ah)
[00:14.15] That we shoot across the sky (symphony, pour on a...)
[00:19.54] That we shoot across the sky
[00:21.55] Drink from me, drink from me (oh-ah-oh-ah)
[00:25.07] That we shoot across the sky (symphony, so high, so high)
[00:30.57] That we shoot across the sky
[00:44.57] 
[00:41.84] Oh, angel sent from up above
[00:46.97] You know you make my world light up
[00:52.47] When I was down, when I was hurt
[00:57.88] You came to lift me up
[01:03.03] Life is a drink and love's a drug
[01:08.33] Oh, now I think I must be miles up
[01:13.78] When I was a river dried up
[01:19.06] You came to rain a flood
[01:31.06] 
[01:24.02] You said drink from me, drink from me
[01:27.27] When I was so thirsty
[01:29.72] Poured on a symphony
[01:33.06] Now I just can't get enough
[01:35.20] Put your wings on me, wings on me
[01:37.97] When I was so heavy
[01:40.43] Poured on a symphony
[01:43.66] When I'm low, low, low, low
[01:57.16] 
[01:46.66] I, oh-I, oh-I
[01:50.11] Got me feeling drunk and high, so high, so high
[01:56.89] Oh-I, oh-I, oh-I
[02:00.83] Now I'm feeling drunk and high, so high, so high (woo)
[02:27.83] 
[02:17.62] Oh, angel sent from up above
[02:23.07] I feel you coursing through my blood
[02:28.43] Life is a drink and your love's about
[02:33.73] To make the stars come out
[02:46.73] 
[02:39.14] Put your wings on me, wings on me
[02:41.93] When I was so heavy
[02:44.39] Poured on a symphony
[02:47.59] When I'm low, low, low, low
[03:01.09] 
[02:50.49] I, oh-I, oh-I
[02:54.26] Got me feeling drunk and high, so high, so high
[03:00.86] Oh-I, oh-I, oh-I
[03:04.93] I'm feeling drunk and high, so high, so high
[03:26.93] 
[03:12.04] I, oh-I, oh-I
[03:15.64] La, la, la, la, la, la, la, so high, so high
[03:22.52] I, oh-I, oh-I
[03:26.27] Now I'm feeling drunk and high, so high, so high
[03:50.27] 
[03:31.98] That I shoot across the sky
[03:37.00] That I shoot across the
[03:42.34] That I shoot across the sky
[03:47.70] Let me shoot across the... (Let me shoot)
[03:53.17] Let me shoot across the sky
[03:58.26] Let me shoot across the
[04:03.47] Let me shoot across the sky
